Welcome to the Ghost Writer project.

This project aim at building an engine capable to convert data (and relationships between data) into human readable text.

Ghost Writer will be useful (hopefully essential!) for writing articles, books, papers, reviews, and, in general, all those documents that express concepts and ideas that are representable as a directed graph (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph).

Info on installation, contribution and development status will follow soon.
